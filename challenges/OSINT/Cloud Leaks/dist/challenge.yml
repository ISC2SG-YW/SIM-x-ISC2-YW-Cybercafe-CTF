  Sometimes the biggest leaks aren’t on the dark web… they’re hiding in plain sight.  

  We intercepted a strange keyword during our investigation: **osint-ctf-holiday-2025**.  
  It might be more than just a random string — rumor says it’s connected to a public
  Google Cloud Storage bucket left wide open.  

  Your mission:  
  • Track down the exposed bucket.  
  • Use the token to figure out the bucket’s name.  
  • Find the flag inside the bucket that can be found in common wordlists.

  Submit the contents of the flag file exactly as shown (including braces).

  Example (format only): flag{<XXX>}
value: 1000
type: dynamic
extra:
  initial: 1000
  decay: 25
  minimum: 100

flags:
  - flag{Cloud_OSINT_1337}
